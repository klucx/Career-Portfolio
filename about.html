        <li>I make great use of my time</li>

        <li>I don’t give up on an unsatisfactory project</li>
        <li>I’m very flexible, regardless of the situation</li>
        <li>I am self-motivated</li>
        <li>I am a fast-learner</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I also show adaptibilty in and out of the workplace, so I'm able ensure that who I am working with recieves the best version of me. </p>
