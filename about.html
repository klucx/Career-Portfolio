      <h6>Who Am I?</h6>
      <hr>
      <p>My full name is Gavin Tyler Rupert, and majority of my friends and family consider me to be the nerd of the group. It might have something to do with the fact that I've always been interested in technology and design. It's a nice idea to think about, how computers, TVs, and other electronics work. Ever since I've been fixated on the idea of how electronics work, I've started to gain experience in problem solving to figure out just how I could make things better.
      <br>
      <br>
      I consider myself to be a great fit to any workplace and setting. Some of my most favorable traits include:
      <ul>
        <li>Extremely flexible</li>
        <li>Highly adaptive</li>
        <li>Quick learner</li>
        <li>Patient</li>
        <li>Positive attitude</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>GENERAL BACKGROUND ABOUT ME</h6>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I am 16 years old, born and raised in Mentor, Ohio. Thanks to where we stand in technology, I've grown up surrounded by it. I've been given the opportunity to watch how technology improves in every aspect of including graphics, editing, vehicles, space, and more. Technology is a flourishing industry that will only grow in the future.

      <h6>MY GENERAL EXPERIENCE</h6>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Much of my experience comes from the classes I've taken so far at Mentor High School. My first technology class was as early as middle school, where I took robotics and 3D design. Robotics for me was a great opening to the world of technology. There, I was able to understand and learn how software controls physical objects. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In my sophmore year of high school, I took Computer Science Essentials, which I immediately fell in love with. In this class I recieved the highest average grade I have ever gotten, being a 98%. Furthermore, I was introduced on how programs themselves work. As an introduction, we worked heavily with Scratch, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In my current year as a junior, I've began taking a Career Tech Education program known as Programming & Software Development. I spend nearly half my day studying and practicing fundamentals in programming, visual programming, web design, and more. I've been able to further extend my knowledge through this program.
