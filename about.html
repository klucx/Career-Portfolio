      <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
      <p>My name is Gavin Rupert. At the time of creation, I am 16 years old and a junior at Mentor High School in Mentor, Ohio. I started showing an interested in Computer Science and software development as early as a freshman in high school. I've always been someone who's interested in technology. From an early age I always questioned how things work. I loved to take apart my WII controllers and look at the circuits and wonder, "how do these work?". I decided that's what I wanted to do with  my career.<br>I'm someone who asks a lot of questions and is big on problem solving. Some of my favorable strengths include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I make great use of my time</li>
        <li>I work well with others</li>
        <li>I don’t give up on an unsatisfactory project</li>
        <li>I’m very flexible, regardless of the situation</li>
        <li>I am self-motivated</li>
        <li>I am a fast-learner</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I also show adaptibilty in and out of the workplace, so I'm able ensure that who I am working with recieves the best version of me. </p>
